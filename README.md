This identification document, ID card, or business card needs to be printed, functioning independently without relying on a server.

Understanding the Concept of Serverless Card Printing

Traditional card printing systems depend heavily on a centralized server, which manages data storage and card creation. However, with advancements in printing technology, it becomes possible to produce ID cards, such as CNICs, without this dependence. These systems operate independently, using embedded hardware or local software, thus ensuring quick and reliable card production.

Benefits of Printing CNIC and Business Cards Without a Server

Choosing a serverless approach offers remarkable benefits. First, it eliminates network dependency, reducing the risk of downtime. Second, it enhances security because sensitive data remains localized and isn't transmitted over networks. Additionally, these systems boast faster processing speeds, enabling users to print cards on demand efficiently. Moreover, they simplify the overall workflow, making them suitable for small businesses and individual users.
